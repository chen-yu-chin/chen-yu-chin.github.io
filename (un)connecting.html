                <h3>“(Un)Connecting Memories” is an artistic research project inspired by the artist’s long-standing practice of walking with their grandmother, who has been living with Alzheimer’s. As the illness progresses, the grandmother gradually loses her short-term memory, unable to recall recent events, recognize the time or month, or remember what was just said or done. Yet over the ongoing practice of walking, and through sensory and bodily perceptions, memory returns and reconstructs itself in another form.

                    The artist’s grandmother was born into a farming family and has spent her entire life working with the land. Since her diagnosis six years ago, the artist has been regularly accompanying her on walks from home to the nearby rice fields. Along the way, the grandmother would speak of the details of rice-planting techniques, old neighbors, and childhood memories from her hometown in Fengshan. Though she often forgets that they have walked this route countless times, certain bodily experiences and affective memories are quietly reawakened—perhaps at a turn in the path, or beside a roadside ditch—becoming a form of recollection and recall.
                    
                    Each walk, though the conversations are nearly identical in topic, contains subtle variations. These fragmented memories are rewoven through the rhythm of footsteps, the movement of the body, and the perception of space. What appears to be a repetitive routine in fact holds infinite re-enactments of “first times”, each walk a micro-reconstruction of consciousness and sentiment.
                    
                    The discontinuity of memory exists not only in Alzheimer’s but also in the everyday lives of all people. Our desire to preserve memory, and our fear of forgetting, has been displaced onto technologies and technical objects. Increasingly, we rely on images and digital media as external storage for memory. Nevertheless, this act of preservation is itself embedded with processes of selection, exclusion, and forgetting. We relinquish the use of our bodies to attend, listen, smell, and exchange, thus rendering experience less internalized, and less likely to be summoned or relived in other forms through the body.
                    
                    This project takes “Sanpo” as a practice and carrier for reflecting on memory and forgetting, employing the fluidity and mutability of body and time to interrogate the nature of memory itself. The disjunction of memory does not signify absence but potentiality. The gaps in memory may become spaces for imagination and alternative narrative.

                    The Project Will Unfold in Walking Together / Co-Creation

Prior to the exhibition at the Tokyo Biennale, a public workshop open call will invite people in the Tokyo area with similar experiences or interest to participate. Together with the artist, participants will engage in a shared walk in Tokyo, along routes either chosen by them or discussed and decided collaboratively. Through sharing, conversation, and embodied practice, participants together with the artist will develop their own methodology of “memory cartography” and sensory paths.

The workshop is both a form of artistic co-creation and a process of cohabiting time and exchanging perception. Here, “Sanpo” is treated as a method of (un)connecting—a trajectory that persists through fragmentation, where new rhythms of cognition and awareness generate in between leaps. Walking becomes a way of sensing and reflecting upon the interrelations between space, consciousness, memory, loss, intimacy, and temporality. The process and outcome of the co-creation will be presented through mediums such as texts, images, drawings, sounds during the Tokyo Biennale exhibition. The materials will be juxtaposed and entangled through an experimental narrative form, mediating the diverse lived experiences and languages of the participants, the flows and ruptures of memory, and the fluidity between reality and fiction, intimacy and collectivity.
