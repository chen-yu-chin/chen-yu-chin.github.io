            <h3>Sea monsters symbolize humanity's fear of the ocean and the unknown—a fear rooted in an epistemology long dominated by visual — what can be seen is equated with what can be known. As hidden and imagined entities, can sea monsters be more than just objects of fascination, but offer an alternative to the visual-oriented, land-centric epistemologies?
                <br><br>
                "On Sea Monster as Medium" is an ongoing artistic research project that proposes and connects multiple issues through the lens of sea monster studies. Working across artistic practice, speculative research, and writing to engage intersecting discourses on media, ecology, technology, colonialism, geo-relations, and identity. The research process embraces neurodiverse methods, open to multiple extensions, leaps of thought, and non-linear thinking.
                <br><br>
                The project currently includes "The Bloop Case Study" (<a href="bloop.html">paper</a>) , looking into how an undefined underwater recording known as the “Bloop” became a digital mythology of the Anthropocene through the imagination of listening. The image of the sea monster has always been mediated—manifesting through oral mythology, 16th-century nautical cartography, low-resolution digital imagery, and undefined underwater recordings. The appearance and disappearance of sea monsters as cultural symbols reflect the evolution and alternative uses of media technologies across temporal and spatial contexts. These involve diverse modes of expression, dissemination, social structures, and ways of seeing and listening. "The Bloop Case Study" analyzes the formation of the Bloop sea monster and its associated internet phenomenon through the lenses of sound studies and media geology, linking mythological imagination, military agendas, underwater infrastructure, climate change, internet culture, and media platforms into a complex cross-temporal ecological system.

                The radio play <a href="the_wetness_of_slow_devour.html">“The Wetness of Slow Devour"</a>  developed during the residency at ZKM, reinterprets underwater recordings from the Alb, Rhine, and Karlsruhe's harbor through acts of listening, connecting, and misunderstanding. By juxtaposing the auditory imagination of sea monsters reverberating through the deep with the machinery, sonar, electromagnetic pulses beating against the current of reality, the piece focuses on sound as a medium that wanders between reality and fiction, mythology and technology, worlding multiple oceanic futures. Through the combination of electroacoustic composition and vocal narration, the radio play creates a site of sea monster mythology and oceanic imagination to explore the theme of devouring across technological, social, ecological, and affective realities. The act of devouring is a constant process for humans, both as devourers and as the devoured. We devour energy, light, organisms, non-organisms, land, rivers, minerals, oil, others, love, intimacy - and at the same time, we are devoured by industry, capitalism, ideologies, networks, information, war, responsibilities, emotions, morality, possibilities, repetition, dreams, and reality.
